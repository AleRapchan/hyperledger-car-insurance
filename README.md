# Hyperledger Car Insurance

## State machine for a car accident insurance claim
### Finite-State Machine
- Mathematical model of computation
- An abstract machine that can be in only one of a finite number of states at one time.
- It can move from one state to another based on inputs
- Changing a state is called a transition
- An example of a state machine in use is a traffic light

### States
- States are used to represent a step in a process
- The state you are in may be dictated by data
  - Time in state
  - Balance of account
  - Measurement input
- The state can be read or changed


## Identifying the state data

## Identifying the transition functions

## Identify the roles

## The chaincode
